# Slay the Spire - Map Generator & Visualizer

This project allows you to generate and visualize game maps similar to those found in "Slay the Spire".

## How to Use

1.  **Generate the Map Data:**
    *   Run the Python script: `python map_generator.py`
    *   This will print JSON data to your console. Copy this entire JSON output.

2.  **Visualize the Map:**
    *   Open the `map_display.html` file in your web browser.
    *   Paste the copied JSON data into the text area labeled "Paste Map JSON Data Here:".
    *   Click the "Render Map" button.
    *   The map should now be displayed on the canvas below.

## Features

*   **Random Map Generation:** Creates randomized map layouts based on Slay the Spire mechanics.
*   **Visual Map Display:** Renders the map structure on an HTML canvas.
*   **Node Types:** Differentiates between various location types (Monster, Elite, Merchant, Rest Site, Treasure, Event, Boss) with distinct colors and symbols.
*   **Path Connectivity:** Shows connections between nodes across different floors.
*   **Rule-Based Generation:** Incorporates game rules for location placement, such as:
    *   Ascension 20 odds for location types.
    *   Floor-specific restrictions (e.g., Elites/Rest Sites not below Floor 6).
    *   Rules to prevent consecutive restricted room types.
    *   Guaranteed treasure on Floor 9 and rest sites on Floor 15.
*   **JSON Data Interface:** Uses JSON data as an intermediary format between the generator and visualizer.

## Files

*   **`map_generator.py`**:
    *   A Python script that programmatically generates the Slay the Spire map layout.
    *   It applies game rules and location probabilities to create a structured map.
    *   Outputs the map data in JSON format to the console.
*   **`map_display.html`**:
    *   An HTML file that visualizes the map generated by `map_generator.py`.
    *   It contains JavaScript to parse the JSON data and draw the map on an HTML canvas, including nodes, edges, colors, and symbols.
    *   Provides a text area to paste the JSON and a button to trigger rendering.

## Potential Future Enhancements

*   **Direct Data Transfer:** Implement a way for `map_generator.py` to directly launch or pass data to `map_display.html` (e.g., using a local web server or file output/input) instead of manual copy-pasting.
*   **More Customization:**
    *   Allow users to select different Ascension levels or rule sets.
    *   Adjust map parameters like number of rows, columns, or path density.
*   **Improved Visuals:**
    *   Enhanced graphics or animations.
    *   Better handling of path crossings or dense maps.
*   **Interactive Map Editing:** Allow users to click on nodes to see more info or (hypothetically) modify the map.
*   **Seed-Based Generation:** Implement a seed system for reproducible map generation.
*   **Export Options:** Allow exporting the visualized map as an image.

## Technologies Used

*   **Python 3:** For the map generation logic.
    *   `random`: For random choices in map generation.
    *   `json`: For creating the JSON output.
    *   `enum`: For defining location types.
*   **HTML5:** For the structure of the display page.
*   **CSS3:** For styling the display page.
*   **JavaScript (ES6+):** For rendering the map on the HTML canvas and handling user interaction on the display page.
    *   Canvas API: Used for drawing the map.
